# Eat Da Burger

## Description

A web application that takes a burger from the user, then adds the burger to a waiting room waiting to be devoured. Once the user clicks on the 'Devour It!' button, the burger will be moved to a 'Past Burgers' list.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MySQL
* Handlebars.js

## Installation

````
npm i express express-handlebars mysql
````

## Goal of the Project

**Create a Restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat**

As a full-stack web application, I needed to follow an MVC design pattern when creating my app. Therefore, I used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Usage
